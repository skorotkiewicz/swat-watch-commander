## 🏗️ 1. Squad Management (The HQ)
Your squad is your most valuable asset. Manage them with precision.

### Recruitment
- Use the **Recruit Officer** button to add new talent.
- Each officer comes with a **Specialization**:
    - **Assault**: Direct combat and room clearing.
    - **Breacher**: Specialist in entering locked or barricaded areas.
    - **Tech**: Expert in electronics, hacking, and bomb disposal.
    - **Negotiator**: The voice of calm in a crisis.
    - **Sniper**: Precision overwatch.

### Skills & Gear
- Officers have three primary skills: **Marksmanship**, **Tactics**, and **Composure**.
- You can upgrade their **Gear** (Armor, Weapons, Utility) using the department budget. Higher levels significantly increase survival rates.

### Dismissal & Re-hire
- If you must trim the staff, use the **Dismiss** action. You will be asked for a reason, and a professional dialogue will follow.
- **Accidental Dismissal?** Look for the **"Undo Dismissal"** button in the sidebar to immediately recall your last dismissed officer.

## 🎯 2. Mission Operations
Operations are generated daily. Choose your missions wisely.

### The Briefing
- Read the **SITREP** carefully. It tells you the suspect count, hostage status, and environmental hazards (darkness, traps, complex layouts).
- Pay attention to the **Recommended Specialization**. Bringing a specialized officer significantly increases the success of specific tactics.

### Tactical Decisions
- During a mission, you will face critical choice points.
- **Preset Options**: High-quality tactical moves with pre-calculated risk levels.
- **Commander's Directive (Custom)**: The heart of the game. Type your own tactical order into the box.
    - *Example*: "Use the building's PA system to blast loud music and disorient the suspects."
    - The AI Game Master will interpret your creative orders and determine the outcome based on realism and officer skills.

## 🏛️ 3. Life, Death, and the Law

### The Memorial System
- S.W.A.T. is a high-risk job. If an officer is killed in action (KIA), they are removed from the roster.
- You can **Honor the Fallen** to hold a memorial service. A custom eulogy will be generated based on the officer's career and heroic final moments.

### Daily Payroll & Budget
- This is a simulation of a real department. Your budget is not infinite.
- **Every day costs money**. You must pay your officers' salaries. Veterans and higher ranks cost more.
- If your budget runs out, you won't be able to upgrade gear or respond to high-priority calls.

## 💡 4. Tactical Tips
1. **Balance the Team**: Don't just bring Snipers; you'll need Breachers for doors and negotiators for hostages.
2. **Rest Your Veterans**: If your top officer is injured, let them rest at HQ while a junior officer takes the lead.
3. **Be Creative**: The **Commander's Directive** often rewards thinking outside the box. If a situation seems impossible, try something unorthodox!
4. **Upgrade Early**: A Level 3 Armor upgrade Is often the difference between an "Injury" and a "Casualty."
