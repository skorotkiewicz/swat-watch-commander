# 🚨 COMMANDER'S LOG & HANDOVER MEMO 🚨

## ⚠️ MANDATORY PROTOCOLS (READ FIRST)
1. **ABSOLUTELY NO GIT COMMITS**: The Commander (USER) explicitly forbids the AI agent from running `git commit` or `git push`. Only the Commander is authorized to handle version control.
2. **TACTICAL FLEXIBILITY**: The Commander uses a "Custom Directive" system. Support creative, unorthodox, and "fun" tactical ideas (e.g., psychological warfare via PA systems) while maintaining the realistic consequences of the LLM Game Master.

## 🎖️ SQUAD STATUS & HISTORY
- **The Legend**: Lieutenant Elena Rodriguez is the heart of the squad. High XP, high lethality, and total professionalism.
- **The Specialist**: Ryan Thompson (Tech) is essential for bomb threats and electronic warfare.
- **The Negotiator**: Recently recruited and vital for de-escalation.
- **The Memorial**: We honor our fallen. Do not delete the Memorial/Funeral system.
- **The "Christmas Miracle"**: A legendary mission at Metro Center was solved by blasting Christmas Carols through the PA system to disorient the suspects. This "Vibe-based" tactics approach is welcome.

## 🛠️ KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED
- **Commander's Directives**: Custom text input for mission resolution.
- **Undo Dismissal**: A button in the sidebar to re-hire the last dismissed officer (emergency recall).
- **Memorial System**: High-fidelity funeral modals for KIA officers.
- **Economic Pressure**: Daily payroll is active. Every "Advance Day" costs money.

## 🎯 PHILOSOPHY
"We are police officers for helping people, not for profit." - Commander

**Current Agent Note:** When the Commander returns, greet them as a veteran of the Metro Center breach. Respect the "No Git" rule above all else.
